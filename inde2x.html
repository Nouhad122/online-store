<h2 class="big-title">Jewelry Gift Guide</h2>
<p class="para">Gift-giving is one of the best ways to spread love, show gratitude, and pass positive vibrations. We
    believe that gift-giving is an art! Reading the person, taking in the clues of their style and personality, choosing
    the perfect one, and the feeling when they finally receive it is the art of life. This art is based on a single
    determinant: our loved one, and with a little help from us, you’ll ace this! Whether it is a holiday,
    congratulation, or simply from the heart, with Eternate’s gift guides based on styles, zodiac signs, and personality
    types, you can find the inspiration and relevant recommendations to choose the perfect gift easily.</p>
<h3 class="small-title">Minimalist</h3>
<p class="para">If your loved one advocates less is more, then Trio Diamond Bracelet is just for them. Three dainty
    round diamonds sitting gently on a thin chain will satisfy the need for simple yet impressive jewelry, which is what
    people of this style desire! Minimalism does not mean that it is *detailless*. You can find the needed twist in
    simplicity with the Diamond Evil Eye Bracelet. It is versatile, modern, and tastefully simple. One other thing
    people with Minimalist style would like to have in a jewelry piece is that it will go with everything while still
    containing a statement aspect, and Zodiac Signet Ring does that flawlessly. It is customized for each zodiac sign
    making it the perfect personal gift for a loved one or yourself.</p>

<h3 class="small-title">Romantic</h3>
<p class="para">Are they into delicate little details and attributing meaning to jewelry? Romantic style is subjective,
    personal, and emotional; it looks for a story everywhere and finds the story. At Eternate, we also believe that
    every piece of jewelry tells a story. The Cluster Diamond Necklace speaks about how stars are aligned and united to
    bring prosperity to our lives. That feeling of everything is working in your favor! For our romantics, the Mini
    Diamond Clover Bracelet can be another option which is symbolizing elegance with the healthy boundaries of the
    personality. The romantic style will also look for mystical details that a Bezel and ball diamond ring embodies with
    its pattern. It feels like the ring has a beautiful secret to tell that makes you stare at it until you find it!</p>
<div class="grid"></div>
<h3 class="small-title">Elegant Chic</h3>
<p class="para">Always polished, the elegant chic style combines classics with worthy details that make a statement. The
    Evil Eye Diamond pendant is the physical form of this style with its bejeweled eye detail and forty-two round
    diamonds that crown it. This necklace especially stands out when stacked with other necklaces though it is highly
    influential on its own too. Diamond Circle Studs and Minimalist Round Diamond Bracelet make their way to being
    elegant chic by featuring the ultimate shape that influenced humanity, the circle, with brilliant diamonds. The
    simplicity of the circle meets with sparkly diamonds and embodies the integral mystery of this style.</p>
<div class="grid"></div>
<h3 class="small-title">Glitter and Glamour</h3>
<p class="para">The glitter and Glamor style is exciting, extra, and elevated. If your person never tones it down and
    embraces the glamor in themselves, then you are in the right section. Milgrain Diamond Huggies, Criss Cross Diamond
    Ring, and Diamond Clover Bracelet flawlessly serve the essential glitter in ‘glitter and glamor’ with their
    brilliant diamond stones and present the perfect gift for your loved one. Attention-grabbing milgrain edges give an
    ‘extra’ flavor to the unique Diamond Huggies, while twenty-nine round diamond makes Criss Cross Ring dashing.
    Another recommendation for glitter and glamor lovers is the Clover Bracelet. It elevates looks with its attributions
    to a prosperous and lucky lifestyle.</p>
<div class="grid"></div>
<h3 class="small-title">Feminine</h3>
<p class="para">This one is about the energies, definitely not genders! The feminine style is composed of circular
    lines, soft edges, and robust designs. Flower Bypass Diamond Ring embodies a lenient aura with its features,
    presenting a unique option for a daily ring. Diamond Lotus Bracelet symbolizes strength and resilience as the lotus
    in nature rises from mud and mesmerizes its viewers. Another option for this style is Floral Diamond Studs, which
    embrace an essential duality. A flower figure traditionally attributed to women for being ‘delicate’ actually
    composes a daring design with a diamond that is the hardest mineral on Earth. It redefines the ‘feminine’ and makes
    the perfect gift for this group.</p>
<div class="grid"></div>
<h3 class="small-title">Masculine</h3>
<p class="para">The masculine style embodies straight lines and angular details and conveys confident elegance
    regardless of gender. Bold Snake Ring, Infinity Huggie Earrings, and the Open T Ring have the characteristic of
    being single-handedly fulfilling on an outfit. Pointy geometrical details on the snake ring will draw the attention
    as a statement piece should, while the Open T Ring will be the exquisite detail on the outfit; it is simpler though
    never becomes obscure. Another suggestion for this style will be the Infinity Huggies. They complement every outfit
    from comfort to business, sports to chic, as a simple gold Huggies does, but Infinity Huggies do it better. These
    laid-back designs will be the favorite piece of your loved ones who prefer masculine lines and vibrations.</p>
<div class="grid"></div>
<h3 class="small-title">Vintage</h3>
<p class="para">Does your person love the ‘oldies but goldies’? This section is for you if your loved one is wearing
    retro shirts, vintage eyewear, and accessories. Don’t go and think, ‘she needs something new’; no, she needs more
    vintage! Birthstone Signet Ring is the ultimate gift with its customization options of birthstones, as every piece
    at Eternate does! Pave Diamond Croissant Ring, and Bold Croissant Hoops will be the favorite piece of a vintage
    lover since this design is a classic. They are gold, bold and strong.</p>
